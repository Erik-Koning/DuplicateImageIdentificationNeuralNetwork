# DuplicateImageIdentificationNeuralNetwork
Data is exploding. Its a good thing when its all organized but duplicate images can arise from careless handling, or copywrite issues. 
This program is designed to find duplicate images.

Requires OpenCV2, python 2.7, tensorflow 1.0.1, and more. 

You can compile OpenCV2 with the following tutorial

or install it using pip install opencv-python (--user if non-admin).

For documentation on Tensorflow 1.0.1 see
